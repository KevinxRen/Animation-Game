Project 3 - Animation Game "Basketball Shoot"
Kevin Ren
CS 441 

I used SpriteKit to define the phyiscs bodies and applied a PNG texture to
over the physic body to display the ball and hoop walls.

The animation durations and bounce effect are all functions built into SpriteKit.

What works:
The ball shoots and bounces.

What doesn't:
The ball's physics aren't defined perfectly yet and some throws arc in a weird way.

The score board isn't working fully.
